# Object-detection-and-localization
Detects, classifies and draws boundary boxes around numbers from an altered MNIST dataset. 

Unfortinatly, this project does not include any of the datasets, as the files are too big. All models except SkreNet is present, SkreNet was also unfortinatly too big. As the datasets is not included it is not possible to recreate the results.
